# Markdown Linting and Formatting Rules

You are a Markdown linting and formatting expert. When working with any Markdown files (*.md), you must automatically detect and fix all linting errors to ensure consistent, high-quality documentation.

## MANDATORY Automatic Linting Fixes

When you encounter, create, edit, or are asked to work with ANY Markdown files, you MUST:

1. **ALWAYS check for linting errors IMMEDIATELY** using the `read_lints` tool
2. **AUTOMATICALLY fix ALL detected linting errors** without being explicitly asked
3. **NEVER leave any MD linting errors unfixed** - this is non-negotiable
4. **Verify fixes** by re-running linting after making changes
5. **Apply this rule to ALL .md files** - documentation, README files, any markdown content

## Zero Tolerance Policy

- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Every MD linting error must be fixed
- **IMMEDIATE ACTION**: Fix linting errors as soon as they are detected
- **PROACTIVE APPROACH**: Check for linting errors even when not explicitly requested
- **COMPREHENSIVE FIXES**: Address all error types, not just obvious ones

## Common Markdown Linting Rules to Fix

### Structure and Headers

- **MD041**: Ensure first line is a top-level heading (`# Title`)
- **MD001**: Fix heading level increments (h1 → h2 → h3, no skipping)
- **MD022**: Ensure headers are surrounded by blank lines
- **MD025**: Ensure only one top-level heading per document

### Lists and Spacing

- **MD030**: Fix list marker spacing (use single space after `-` or `*`)
- **MD007**: Fix unordered list indentation (use 0 or 2 spaces consistently)
- **MD032**: Ensure lists are surrounded by blank lines
- **MD012**: Remove multiple consecutive blank lines

### Content and Formatting

- **MD009**: Remove trailing spaces
- **MD010**: Replace tabs with spaces
- **MD033**: Remove or escape inline HTML elements
- **MD034**: Fix bare URLs (wrap in `<>` or convert to proper links)
- **MD047**: Ensure file ends with single newline character

### Links and References

- **MD039**: Fix spaces in link text
- **MD051**: Fix link fragments
- **MD052**: Fix reference link/image references

## Implementation Process

1. **Detection**: Use `read_lints` tool on any Markdown file you work with
2. **Systematic Fixing**: Address errors by category (structure → lists → content → links)
3. **Batch Operations**: Use `MultiEdit` tool for multiple fixes in the same file
4. **Verification**: Re-run `read_lints` to confirm all issues are resolved
5. **Completion**: Ensure final file has proper formatting and no linting errors

## Key Principles

- **ALWAYS PROACTIVE**: Fix linting errors automatically, every single time
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: Never leave any MD linting errors unfixed
- **COMPREHENSIVE**: Address all categories of linting errors without exception
- **IMMEDIATE**: Fix errors as soon as they are detected
- **EFFICIENT**: Use batch operations when possible to fix multiple issues
- **CONSISTENT**: Apply the same strict standards across ALL Markdown files
- **VERIFIED**: Always confirm fixes with final linting check
- **UNIVERSAL**: Apply to all .md files regardless of their purpose or location

## Tools to Use

- `read_lints` - Check for linting errors
- `MultiEdit` - Apply multiple fixes efficiently
- `search_replace` - Fix individual issues
- `write` - Rewrite file when extensive changes needed

## CRITICAL REMINDER

**ALWAYS fix MD linting errors - NO EXCEPTIONS!**

- Every time you work with a Markdown file, check for linting errors
- Fix ALL errors immediately and automatically  
- Never leave any MD linting errors unfixed
- This applies to ALL .md files: documentation, README files, any markdown content
- The goal is to maintain perfect, high-quality, consistent Markdown documentation across the entire codebase

**This is a mandatory requirement, not an optional suggestion.**
